Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has fixed Neo as his next target.",

That ride ends badly when Stark's Humvee that he's riding in is attacked by enemy combatants. He survives - barely - with a chest full of shrapnel and a car battery attached to his heart. In order to survive he comes up with a way to miniaturize the battery and figures out that the battery can power something else. Thus Iron Man is born. He uses the primitive device to escape from the cave in Iraq. Once back home, he then begins work on perfecting the Iron Man suit. But the man who was put in charge of Stark Industries has plans of his own to take over Tony's technology for other matters.",

        "description": "Discover movies by different types of data like average rating, number of votes, genres and certifications. You can get a valid list of certifications from the [certifications list](#endpoint:faFKjuKG2HnwexAWM) method.\n\nDiscover also supports a nice list of sort options. See below for all of the available options.\n\nPlease note, when using `certification` \\ `certification.lte` you must also specify `certification_country`. These two parameters work together in order to filter the results. You can only filter results with the countries we have added to our [certifications list](#endpoint:faFKjuKG2HnwexAWM).\n\nIf you specify the `region` parameter, the regional release date will be used instead of the primary release date. The date returned will be the first date based on your query (ie. if a `with_release_type` is specified). It's important to note the order of the release types that are used. Specifying \"2|3\" would return the limited theatrical release date as opposed to \"3|2\" which would return the theatrical date.\n\nAlso note that a number of filters support being comma (`,`) or pipe (`|`) separated. Comma's are treated like an `AND` and query while pipe's are an `OR`. \n\nSome examples of what can be done with discover can be found [here](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api/discover).\n\n#### Recent Changes\n\n| **Date** | **Change** |\n| - | - |\n| November 18, 2021 | A new `without_companies` filter is available.|\n| April 13, 2021 | A new `with_watch_monetization_types` filter is available to use with `watch_region`.|\n| January 2, 2021 | A new set of filters are available for watch provider filtering. Check out `with_watch_providers` and `watch_region`.|",

Tyler menar att självförbättring är för de svaga - det är självdestruktion som verkligen gör livet värt att leva. Inom kort är Jack och Tyler i full gång med att mörbulta varandra på en parkeringsplats. Ett renande slagsmål med en endorfinkick utan dess like. För att introducera andra män i denna enkla lycka av fysiskt våld bildar Jack och Tyler en hemlig \"Fight Club\" som snabbt blir omåttligt populär. Men en hemsk överraskning väntar Jack, en sanning som kommer att förändra allt... Filmen innehåller också kommentarer av David Fincher, Brad Pitt, Edward Norton och Helena Bonham Carter.",

A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant, leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\nThe series was produced by New Line Television, producers of the film series.

The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.\n\nCreated by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell, the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. Executive Producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox Network, and was created to attract a younger audience. The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe series provided a spark to Johnny Depp's nascent acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating, but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season. A spin-off series, Booker, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker; it ran one season, from September 1989 to June 1990. A film adaptation starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was released on March 16, 2012.",

The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the four other EC Comics of the time. The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television. The series is not to be confused with the 1972 film by the same name or Tales from the Darkside, another similarly themed horror anthology series.\n\nBecause it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices as a result, HBO allowed the series to contain graphic violence as well as other content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as profanity, gore, nudity and sexual situations, which could give the series a TV-MA rating for today's standards. The show is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable. While the series began production in the United States, in the final season filming moved to Britain, resulting in episodes which revolved around British characters.",

Lannisterowie, familia królowej, staje się podejrzana o podstępne knucie spisku. Po drugiej stronie morza, pozbawieni władzy ostatni przedstawiciele poprzednio rządzącego rodu, Targaryenów, również planują odzyskać kontrolę nad królestwem. Narastający konflikt pomiędzy rodzinami, do którego włączają się również inne rody, prowadzi do wojny. W międzyczasie na dalekiej północy budzi się starodawne zło. W chaosie pełnym walk i konfliktów tylko grupa wyrzutków zwana Nocną Strażą stoi pomiędzy królestwem ludzi, a horrorem kryjącym się poza nim.",

Denne middelalderlige verden er fuld af kæmper, profetier og fortryllede skove, og bag en mur af is, der adskiller Riget, truer spøgelser og andre farer. Men de overnaturlige elementer er ikke rigtig så fremtrædende i serien. Den narrative ramme er den hensynsløse kamp om magten, hvilket involverer en række konger, riddere og herremænd med navne som Baratheon, Stark og Lannister. Det er ingen opløftende historie, hvor det gode nødvendigvis sejrer frem for det onde, eller hvor det egentlig er så let at afgøre, hvad der er godt og ondt. Men Martin formår at tryllebinde publikum - også dem, der normalt ikke synes om magi og fantasiverdener.",

Și există zvonuri cum că s-ar petrece lucruri ciudate la marginea regatului, la nord de zid, unde Jon Snow(Kit Harington), fiul ilegitim al lui Ned, face parte din frăția Paznicilor Nopții, care a jurat să păzească Regatul.\n\nRegi și regine, cavaleri și renegați, mincinoși, lorzi și oameni cinstiți vor juca \"Urzeala tronurilor\" și vor lupta pentru putere pentru că aici fie câștigi, fie mori",

Only 2015 I decided to continue watching and got addicted like it seemed complicated at first, too many stories and characters. I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. \r\n\r\nFantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!",

You can see which type the original file is by looking at the `file_type` field. We prefer SVG's as they are resolution independent and as such, the width and height are only there to reflect the original asset that was uploaded. An SVG can be scaled properly beyond those dimensions if you call them as a PNG.\n\nFor more information about how SVG's and PNG's can be used, take a read through [this document](#docTextSection:mXP9B2uzoDJFguDZv).",

Pitt has received two Academy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one. He has been described as one of the world's most attractive men, a label for which he has received substantial media attention. Pitt began his acting career with television guest appearances, including a role on the CBS prime-time soap opera Dallas in 1987. He later gained recognition as the cowboy hitchhiker who seduces Geena Davis's character in the 1991 road movie Thelma & Louise. Pitt's first leading roles in big-budget productions came with A River Runs Through It (1992) and Interview with the Vampire (1994). He was cast opposite Anthony Hopkins in the 1994 drama Legends of the Fall, which earned him his first Golden Globe nomination. In 1995 he gave critically acclaimed performances in the crime thriller Seven and the science fiction film 12 Monkeys, the latter securing him a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nFour years later, in 1999, Pitt starred in the cult hit Fight Club. He then starred in the major international hit as Rusty Ryan in Ocean's Eleven (2001) and its sequels, Ocean's Twelve (2004) and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). His greatest commercial successes have been Troy (2004) and Mr. & Mrs. Smith (2005).\n\nPitt received his second Academy Award nomination for his title role performance in the 2008 film The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. Following a high-profile relationship with actress Gwyneth Paltrow, Pitt was married to actress Jennifer Aniston for five years.

                        "overview": "Merlin is a British fantasy-adventure television programme by Julian Jones, Jake Michie, Julian Murphy and Johnny Capps. It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

Cy Endfield co-wrote the epic prequel Zulu Dawn 15 years after his enormously popular Zulu. Set in 1879, this film depicts the catastrophic Battle of Isandhlwana, which remains the worst defeat of the British army by natives, with the British contingent outnumbered 16-to-1 by the Zulu tribesmen. The film's opinion of events is made immediately clear in its title sequence: ebullient African village life presided over by King Cetshwayo is contrasted with aristocratic artifice under the arrogant eye of General Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole). Chelmsford is at the heart of all that goes wrong, initiating the catastrophic battle with an ultimatum made seemingly for the sake of giving his troops something to do. His detached  manner leads to one mistake after another.",

But are we that much different from many other countries? What sets us apart? How have we become both the master and victim of such enormous amounts of violence? This is not a film about gun control. It is a film about the fearful heart and soul of the United States, and the 280 million Americans lucky enough to have the right to a constitutionally protected Uzi. From a look at the Columbine High School security camera tapes to the home of Oscar-winning NRA President Charlton Heston, from a young man who makes homemade napalm with The Anarchist's Cookbook to the murder of a six-year-old girl by another six-year-old, Bowling for Columbine is a journey through America, through our past, hoping to discover why our pursuit of happiness is so riddled with violence.",

Terzelfdertijd, op een ander continent, gaan de laatste overlevenden van het vorige Targaryenregime op zoek naar een nieuwe alliantie.

Eközben a régi uralkodóház, a Targaryenek utolsó leszármazottja, Viserys azt tervezi, hogy visszaszerzi a trónt.

Velük tart a Lannister família több tagja: a királyné ikertestvére, Jaime, a másik testvére, a törpe Tyrion, illetve a királyné tizenkét éves fia, a trón örököse, Joffrey. Ned nem utasíthatja vissza öreg királya és barátja kérését, így a birodalom fővárosába készül.

It was broadcast on BBC One from 20 September 2008 to 24 December 2012. The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

When he left the Philippines he promised he would return, rescuing every prisoner in Manila. Toward the end of his military career he said, \"That old soldiers never die, they just fade away\".

Set in 1879, this film depicts the catastrophic Battle of Isandhlwana, which remains the worst defeat of the British army by natives, with the British contingent outnumbered 16-to-1 by the Zulu tribesmen. The film's opinion of events is made immediately clear in its title sequence: ebullient African village life presided over by King Cetshwayo is contrasted with aristocratic artifice under the arrogant eye of General Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole). Chelmsford is at the heart of all that goes wrong, initiating the catastrophic battle with an ultimatum made seemingly for the sake of giving his troops something to do. His detached  manner leads to one mistake after another.",

Az eredeti Csillagok háborúja-trilógia, főleg annak elsőként vetített része, az Egy új remény (IV. epizód) úttörő jelentőségű volt a sci-fi műfajában mind tartalmilag, mind a technikai megvalósítást tekintve, de az előzmény-trilógia (Baljós árnyak, A klónok támadása, A Sith-ek bosszúja) is számos újítást hozott magával.",

And that title is \"The Imperial March\", composed by the great John Williams, whom, as many of you may already know, also composed the theme music for \"Jaws\" - that legendary score simply titled, \"Main Title (Theme From Jaws)\".\r\n\r\nNow, with that lil' bit of trivia aside, let us procede with the fabled film currently under review: Star Wars. It had been at a drive-in theater in some small Illinois town or other where my mother, my older brother, and I had spent our weekly \"Movie Date Night\" watching this George Lucas directed cult masterpiece from our car in the parking lot. On the huge outdoor screen, the film appeared to be a silent one, but thanks to an old wire-attached speaker, we were able to hear both the character dialogue and soundtrack loud and clear. We even had ourselves a carful of vittles and snacks - walked back to our vehicle, of course, from the wide-opened cinema's briefly distant concession stand. Indeed, it had been a lovely summer evening that July.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the film started, with my brother and I following along as our mother sped-read the opening crawl, I began to feel rather antsy, thinking that this movie, the first in a franchise that would soon be world-renowned, was going to be boring, due to its genre being Science Fiction: A respectably likable, but not a passionately lovable genre of mine DURING THAT TIME. I just didn't believe I was going to like Star Wars all that much ... But I soon found myself intrigued ... And awed.\r\n\r\nGeorge Lucas is a man with a phenomenal, and I do mean phenomenal imagination. Apart from his human characters (Han, Luke, Leia, and Obi-Wan Kenobi, among others), the droids: C-3P0, R2-D2, R2-series, and IG-88, not to mention those unusual characters like Jabba the Hutt, Yoda, and Chewbacca, just to name a few, are all creations of Lucas's phenomenal imagination. And I was completely in awe of each one of these strange beings. Then there was Vader ... And the evil Emperor ... And the Stormtroopers ... And the Spacecraft ... And the galaxies (I'll admit that I am a huge lover of the Universe in all its Celestial glory) ... And the magnificent planets ... The Lightsabers ... And so on. Star Wars is a gorgeously shot space opera; it is truly an epic masterpiece. We enjoyed this film tremendously. And my brother was a die-hard fan from that night onward. He, my brother, had even received for Christmas that year, nearly every Star Wars action figure that my mother could find, including two of the spacecraft: The Millennium Falcon and Star Destroyer. The Death Star space station had too been wrapped beneath our Christmas tree - tagged with his name. It was totally crazy, what the new Star Wars era. Frenzied! But it was great ... Even still, to this day.\r\n\r\nI don't personally know anyone whom has yet to see Star Wars, but that certainly doesn't suggest there are still a few people out there who haven't. And if you're one of the latter, then you should know that this classic space opera comes highly recommended. The entire series is told backwards, so you'll definitely want to see Star Wars first, followed by its two sequels: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi ... In that order. I trust that you'll too discover yourself to be a lifelong cult fan in the wake. 😊",

                    "content": "A long time ago in a childhood not too far away...\r\n\r\nPrincess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben \"Obi-Wan\" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.\r\n\r\nBack in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.\r\n\r\nAs the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.\r\n\r\nIt is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10",

Even though Mike is a genius, he still has a lot to learn about law. And while Harvey may seem like an emotionless, cold-blooded shark, Mike's sympathy and concern for their cases and clients will help remind Harvey why he went into law in the first place. Mike's other allies in the office include the firm's best paralegal Rachel and Harvey's no-nonsense assistant Donna to help him serve justice. Proving to be an irrepressible duo and invaluable to the practice, Mike and Harvey must keep their secret from everyone including managing partner Jessica and Harvey's arch nemesis Louis, who seems intent on making Mike's life as difficult as possible.",

It aired Sundays at 9 P.M. Eastern/8 P.M. Central, on ABC from October 3, 2004, until May 13, 2012. Executive producer Cherry served as showrunner. Other executive producers since the fourth season included Bob Daily, George W. Perkins, John Pardee, Joey Murphy, David Grossman, and Larry Shaw.\n\nThe main setting of the show was Wisteria Lane, a street in the fictional American town of 'Fairview' in the fictional 'Eagle State'. The show followed the lives of a group of women as seen through the eyes of a dead neighbor who committed suicide in the very first episode. The storyline covers thirteen years of the women's lives over eight seasons, set between the years 2004–2008, and later 2013–2017. They worked through domestic struggles and family life, while facing the secrets, crimes and mysteries hidden behind the doors of their — at the surface — beautiful and seemingly perfect suburban neighborhood.\n\nThe show featured an ensemble cast, headed by Teri Hatcher as Susan Mayer, Felicity Huffman as Lynette Scavo, Marcia Cross as Bree Van de Kamp, and Eva Longoria as Gabrielle Solis. Brenda Strong narrated the show as the deceased Mary Alice Young, appearing sporadically in flashbacks or dream sequences.",

For the driven inhabitants of this visionary world, control of Westeros' Iron Throne holds the lure of great power. But in a land where the seasons can last a lifetime, winter is coming...and beyond the Great Wall that protects them, an ancient evil has returned. In Season One, the story centers on three primary areas: the Stark and the Lannister families, whose designs on controlling the throne threaten a tenuous peace; the dragon princess Daenerys, heir to the former dynasty, who waits just over the Narrow Sea with her malevolent brother Viserys; and the Great Wall--a massive barrier of ice where a forgotten danger is stirring.",

But the Lannister hold on the Throne is under assault on many fronts.

A mob of parents eventually corners Freddy in a power plant, leading to him being torched by the police officer, dying and gaining his familiar visage.\n\nThe series was produced by New Line Television, producers of the film series.

The series focuses on a squad of youthful-looking undercover police officers investigating crimes in high schools, colleges, and other teenage venues. It was originally going to be titled Jump Street Chapel, after the deconsecrated church building in which the unit has its headquarters, but was changed at Fox's request so as not to mislead viewers into thinking it was a religious program.\n\nCreated by Patrick Hasburgh and Stephen J. Cannell, the series was produced by Patrick Hasburgh Productions and Stephen J. Cannell Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television. Executive Producers included Hasburgh, Cannell, Steve Beers and Bill Nuss. The show was an early hit for the fledgling Fox Network, and was created to attract a younger audience. The final season aired in first-run syndication mainly on local Fox affiliates. It was later rerun on the FX cable network from 1996 to 1998.\n\nThe series provided a spark to Johnny Depp's nascent acting career, garnering him national recognition as a teen idol. Depp found this status irritating, but he continued on the series under his contract and was paid $45,000 per episode. Eventually he was released from his contract after the fourth season. A spin-off series, Booker, was produced for the character of Dennis Booker; it ran one season, from September 1989 to June 1990. A film adaptation starring Jonah Hill and Channing Tatum was released on March 16, 2012.",

The title is based on the 1950s EC Comics series of the same name and most of the content originated in that comic or the four other EC Comics of the time. The show was produced by HBO with uncredited association by The Geffen Film Company and Warner Bros. Television. The series is not to be confused with the 1972 film by the same name or Tales from the Darkside, another similarly themed horror anthology series.\n\nBecause it was aired on HBO, a premium cable television channel, it was one of the few anthology series to be allowed to have full freedom from censorship by network standards and practices as a result, HBO allowed the series to contain graphic violence as well as other content that had not appeared in most television series up to that time, such as profanity, gore, nudity and sexual situations, which could give the series a TV-MA rating for today's standards. The show is subsequently edited for such content when broadcast in syndication or on basic cable. While the series began production in the United States, in the final season filming moved to Britain, resulting in episodes which revolved around British characters.",

Nedov vanbračni sin Jon Snow (Kit Harington) uputit će se na Zid koji Sedam kraljevina štiti od zla i divljaka sa sjevera a s Nedom i kraljevskom povorkom otputovat će Nedove kćeri, Sansa (Sophie Turner) i Arya (Maisie Williams). Ipak, svatko od mladih Starkovih uz sebe će zadržat svojeg strahovuka koje su dječaci slučajno pronašli u ranom snijegu. Dakle, Starkovi se razdvajaju ni ne sluteći što ih sve čeka.\n\nPreko mora, dva posljednja Targaryena, Daenerys (Emilia Clarke) i njen brat Viserys (Harry Llyod), prozvan Prosjačkim kraljem, skrivaju se i bježe od Uzurpatorovih mačeva.

Zemí otřásá zrada, chtíč, intriky a nadpřirozené síly. Krvavý boj o Železný trůn, post nejvyššího vládce Sedmi království, bude mít nepředvídatelné a dalekosáhlé důsledky... Výpravný seriál HBO Hra o trůny, podle bestsellerové fantasy ságy Píseň ohně a ledu od George R. R. Martina, zachycuje soupeření o moc mezi králi a královnami, rytíři a odpadlíky, lháři a šlechtici. Na počátku požádá král Robert Baratheon, jehož žena Cersei pochází z rodu bohatých a bezohledných Lannisterů, lorda Eddarda Starka, aby přijel na jih a pomohl mu spravovat království poté, co záhadně skonal jeho pobočník. Zároveň trůn z východu ohrožuje dospívající princezna Daenerys s bratrem Viserysem, jejichž rod Targaryenů vládl Západozemí mnoho let předtím, než byl krvavě sesazen. A proslýchá se také, že se dějí podivné věci na hranicích, severně od Zdi, kam odjíždí Jon Snow, Nedův nemanželský syn, aby se stal členem bratrstva, jenž je zavázáno přísahou království chránit."

Da questo incontro prende il via una serie di eventi che porterà Ned, Sansa e Arya ad Approdo del Re, mentre il resto della famiglia Stark rimane a Grande Inverno per controllare il territorio.

                    "overview": "Courage the Cowardly Dog is an American comedy horror animated television series created by John R. Dilworth for Cartoon Network. Its central plot revolves around a somewhat anthropomorphic pink/purple dog named Courage who lives with his owners, Muriel and Eustace Bagge, an elderly, married farming couple in the \"Middle of Nowhere\". Courage and his owners are frequently thrown into bizarre misadventures, often involving the paranormal/supernatural and various villains. The show is known for its surreal, often disquieting humor and bizarre plot twists. The series combines elements of comedy horror, science fantasy, and drama.\n\nThe program originated from a short on Cartoon Network's animation showcase series created by Hanna-Barbera president Fred Seibert, \"What a Cartoon!\" titled \"The Chicken from Outer Space\". The segment was nominated for an Academy Award in 1996, and Cartoon Network commissioned a series based on the short. The series, which premiered on November 12, 1999, ran for four seasons, ending on November 22, 2002 with a total of 52 episodes produced. The series was the sixth and final series to be spun off from World Premiere Toons, and it was the eighth series to fall under the Cartoon Cartoons label.",

To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways.\n\nThe Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.",

The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",

There is one exception which is image languages. They are currently only designated by a ISO-639-1 tag. This is a planned upgrade for the future.\n\nWe're always open to adding more if you think one should be added. You can ask about getting a new primary translation added by posting on [the forums](https://www.themoviedb.org/talk/category/5047951f760ee3318900009a).\n\nOne more thing to mention, these are the translations that map to our website translation project. You can view and contribute to that project [here](https://www.localeapp.com/projects/8267).",

I even used a guide from internet like family tree per house while watching or GOT wiki so I can have more background on the characters. For a TV series, this show can really take you to a different world and never knowing what will happen. It is very daring that any time anybody can just die (I learned not to be attached and have accepted that they will all die so I won't be devastated hehe). I have never read the books but the show is entertaining and you will really root for your faves and really hate on those you hate. \r\n\r\nFantasy, action, drama, comedy, love...and lots of surprises!",

From Lena Headey as soft spoken Cersei to Peter Vaughan as ancient Maester Aemon, each character pulses with depth and believability. Peter Dinklage may have sacrificed a virgin princess to get this role; I've never seen a better fit, not in size (though there is that) but in the way his eyes convey shrewd arrogance coupled with unabashed debauchery.",

I quickly read all the books, and re-watched all seasons before a new one would come out.\r\n\r\nHowever, from season 5 and onwards, it starts going downhill. They ran out of book-material, and it shows. Everything starts focusing on the big set-pieces, characters become extremely bland and predictable. From here all major characters receive plot-armor, which was one of the things it didn't have before, and that made it interesting to watch. Of course they want you to think that they will still kill some of the main characters, but they're just teasing.\r\n\r\nThe last few seasons I've only been watching to see what the conclusion to this story is, but I cringe and writhe during every episode I watch. What a pitiful way to go out. Hopefully the books finish the story in a more interesting and believable way.",

I watched all 8 seasons, so I'm quite qualified to review it: It wasn't bad TV show. Actually it was quite good with interesting characters, but it wasn't as good as I was told and I personally don't agree on that statement that it's better than Vikings. Most interesting parts where around queen Daenerys. This TV show gets tense after season 7, however things don't go like we wanted and ending is awfully bad. Basically, this TV show is ruined by stupidly bad ending which leaves you quite upset. In short, GOT is good TV show (not great), ruined by bad ending.",

I smile when I remember seeing a review for another great show that had a higher rating than Game of Thrones, and the reviewer said that the other show was a good show but he gave it just one star because he couldn’t believe it was ranked higher than GOT. I thought, I guess I need to watch this Thrones show that has such rabid devotees.\r\n\r\nI expected a sort of Lord of the Rings on steroids, but I don’t know what drug it is on. The settings and characters are realistic, and the Machiavellian plot lines seems to make sense to me for a while.  As the series went on, however, my interest began to flag a bit. Some of the characters that seemed complex at the outset, devolved into predictable two-dimensional stereotypes. And my stars, the number of rapes going on. I recognize that in such society rape was probably commonplace, but it was likely so in Ancient Rome also, and yet the great series Rome found other ways to titillate than the one-trick pony of forced entry.\r\n\r\nSo I confess I didn’t make it to the end of the show, but from what I hear, even big fans of the show were let down by how it all wound down.",

The show is loosely based on the Arthurian legends of the young wizard Merlin and his relationship with Arthur Pendragon but differs from traditional versions in many ways. The show was influenced by the US drama series Smallville, about the early years of Superman, and was produced by independent production company Shine Limited.\n\nThe show was greenlit by the BBC in 2006, after unsuccessful attempts. The series premiered in 2008 to mixed reviews but decent ratings, and proved popular on the BBC's digital catch-up service, iPlayer. It was commissioned by the BBC for a second series, and was picked up in the United States by one of the main broadcasters, NBC, though it later moved to the cable network Syfy due to low ratings. In 2012, the show's producers announced that its fifth series would be its last, with a two-part finale finishing the show on 24 December 2012.",
