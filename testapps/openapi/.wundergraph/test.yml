          description: >
            If the number of results found for a specific query is less than
            this number, Typesense will attempt to drop the tokens in the query until
            enough results are found. Tokens that have the least individual hits
            are dropped first. Set to 0 to disable. Default: 10

          description: >
            If the number of results found for a specific query is less than this number,

        pinned_hits:
          description: >
            A list of records to unconditionally include in the search results
            at specific positions. An example use case would be to feature or promote
            certain items on the top of search results.
            A list of `record_id:hit_position`. Eg: to include a record with ID 123
            at Position 1 and another record with ID 456 at Position 5,
            you'd specify `123:1,456:5`.

            You could also use the Overrides feature to override search results based
            on rules. Overrides are applied first, followed by `pinned_hits` and 
            finally `hidden_hits`.
          type: string

        hidden_hits:
          description: >
            A list of records to unconditionally hide from search results.
            A list of `record_id`s to hide. Eg: to hide records with IDs 123 and 456,
            you'd specify `123,456`.

            You could also use the Overrides feature to override search results based

        pre_segmented_query:
          description: >
            You can index content from any logographic language into Typesense if you
            are able to segment / split the text into space-separated words yourself 
            before indexing and querying.

            Set this parameter to true to do the same
          type: boolean

        enable_overrides:
          description: >

        prioritize_exact_match:
          description: >

          type: boolean
        exhaustive_search:
          description: >
            Setting this to true will make Typesense consider all prefixes and typo 
            corrections of the words in the query without stopping early when enough results are found 
            (drop_tokens_threshold and typo_tokens_threshold configurations are ignored).
          type: boolean
        search_cutoff_ms:
          description: >
            Typesense will attempt to return results early if the cutoff time has elapsed. 
            This is not a strict guarantee and facet computation is not bound by this parameter.
          type: integer
        use_cache:
          description: >
