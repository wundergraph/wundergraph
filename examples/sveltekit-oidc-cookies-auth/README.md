# WunderGraph Sveltekit Example with OpenID Connect Authentication

## Getting Started

### 1. Install & Start

1. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required values.
2. Install the dependencies and run the complete example in one command:

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

### 3. Use the application

On the SvelteKit frontend, click the "Sign in" button.
Once the login is complete, the backend will insert the logged in user in the database and in the frontend will show how to query the user from a database operation or from the cookie in the request.
