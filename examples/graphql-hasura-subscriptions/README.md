# WunderGraph subscriptions example - graphql-hasura

### Configuration

- Go to: https://hasura.io/learn/graphql/graphiql

You will need to complete a simple signup form (just mail and password) to get access to the
GraphiQL interface, and obtain token.

- Set the authorization header, using the token you obtained from the previous step,
  replace `Secret` with your token in `wundergraph.config.ts`:

````bash
```typescript
const hasura = introspect.graphql({
  apiNamespace: 'hasura',
  url: 'https://hasura.io/learn/graphql',
  headers: (builder) => builder.addStaticHeader('Authorization', 'Secret'),
});
````
