# WunderGraph Hooks

This example demonstrates how to use the `mutatingPostResolve` hook to change the response of the `Dragons` operation. Hooks are the type-safe way to write custom middleware functions. If you need an overview about all possible hooks, please refer to the [WunderGraph Hooks documentation](/docs/hooks.md).

## Getting Started

Install the dependencies and run the complete example in one command:

```shell
npm install && npm start
```

After `npm start` has been executed, your browser should open a new tab and navigate to [`http://localhost:9991/operations/Dragons`](http://localhost:9991/operations/Dragons). In the console, you can see logs emitted by the `mutatingPostResolve` hook.
