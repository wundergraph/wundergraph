# WunderGraph + Astro

This examples shows how to use WunderGraph with [Astro](https://astro.build).

```
npx create-wundergraph-app --example=astro
```

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ .wundergraph/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ wundergraph.config.ts
|   â”œâ”€â”€ wundergraph.operations.ts
|   â”œâ”€â”€ wundergraph.server.ts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ operations/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

WunderGraph operations are placed in the `.wundergraph/operations/` directory. Each file becomes an Operation. Operations can be written in GraphQL or TypeScript.

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                              |
