The [Astro + Relay example](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph/tree/main/examples/astro-relay) demonstrates how to use Relay with a Astro project in SSG mode.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

You can start editing the app by modifying files under `src/pages/` directory. The screen auto-updates as you edit the file.
