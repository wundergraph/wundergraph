The @removeNullVariables directive allows you to remove variables with null value from your GraphQL Query or Mutation Operations.

A potential use-case could be that you have a graphql upstream which is not accepting null values for variables.
By enabling this directive all variables with null values will be removed from upstream query.

query ($say: String, $name: String) @removeNullVariables {
	hello(say: $say, name: $name)
}

Directive will transform variables json and remove top level null values.
{ "say": null, "name": "world" }

So upstream will receive the following variables:

{ "name": "world" }

	        info {
