WunderGraph uses a lot of code generation to give you not just type-safe APIs,
but also type-safe configuration.
We introspect your WunderGraph configuration and generate all the necessary code for you.

You can either to this concurrently in the background,
using `wunderctl up`,
or you also do it on demand using `wunderctl generate`.
