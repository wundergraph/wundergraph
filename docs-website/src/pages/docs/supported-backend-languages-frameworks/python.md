Python is one of the most popular programming languages.
It's a great choice for many use cases, like building web applications, data science, machine learning, and many more.

The architecture of WunderGraph is designed to be language agnostic.
This means that you can use WunderGraph with any programming language.
WunderGraph relies on JSON-RPC, which is a simple protocol over HTTP.

## Status of the Python integration

The Python integration is currently in planning.
Similarly to the integration with Golang,
we need to implement a JSON-RPC client generator for Python.
