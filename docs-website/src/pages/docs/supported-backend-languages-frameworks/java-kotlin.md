Java is one of the most popular programming languages,
while Kotlin is getting more and more traction.
Both languages are widely used in large enterprises and are great choices for many use cases,
like building backend services, Android apps, and many more.

The architecture of WunderGraph is designed to be language agnostic.
This means that you can use WunderGraph with any programming language.
WunderGraph relies on JSON-RPC, which is a simple protocol over HTTP.

## Status of the Java / Kotlin integration

The Java / Kotlin integration is currently in planning.
Similarly to the integration with Golang,
we need to implement a JSON-RPC client generator for Java / Kotlin.
