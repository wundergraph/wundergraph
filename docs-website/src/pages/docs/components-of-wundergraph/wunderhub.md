We talk a lot about explicitly thinking about API dependencies,
API namespacing, the Virtual Graph,
and the package manager for APIs.

WunderHub, together with wunderctl is exactly that,
the package manager for APIs, and a registry to share and manage API dependencies.

The WunderGraph cli can be used to manage API dependencies locally,
and when you'd like to share them with the team,
or even the rest of the world,
you can use WunderHub to do so.

If you want to learn more, check out the reference on how to [publish APIs to the Hub](/docs/wunderhub-reference/publish-api-to-wunderhub),
and how to [integrate APIs from the Hub](/docs/wunderhub-reference/integrate-api-from-wunderhub) into your application.
