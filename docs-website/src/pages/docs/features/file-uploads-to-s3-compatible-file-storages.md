While WunderGraph's main purpose is to deal with structured data,
files / blobs are also an important aspect of building applications.

Your users might not only want to upload content in their applications but also images, PDF files, etc...

We've looked into the various solutions that frameworks offer to make file uploads easy alongside your REST or GraphQL APIs.
What we found is that most solutions are custom and require some extra work either in the client, the server-side or even both.

Our credo is, developer experience first!
For that reason, we've added support for S3 compatible storage providers.

## What is S3?

In case you're already familiar, skip this section.

S3 is a protocol established by AWS that allows clients to upload files to so called "Buckets".
A bucket is simply a folder,
so, S3 allows you to upload files to folders.

However, folders are not really scalable if we're talking about millions of files.
For that reason, AWS made an abstraction on top of distributed file systems that gives you "Buckets" which can be accessed over an HTTP API.

Nowadays, there are many Cloud Providers that implemented the S3 protocol,
allowing you to use S3 without vendor lock-in.

Additionally, there's also Minio, also a storage service provider,
which can be used as a S3 storage on premises or even on your local machine.

## Architecture Overview

WunderGraph generates a type-safe client for your applications.
Part of the client is a file upload handler which can talk to multiple buckets.
Instead of binding a client to a specific S3 compatible instance,
you're able to use different storages depending on the environment,
you're running on.

E.g. you can use Minio on localhost and DigitalOcean spaces when running in production.

Additionally,
you're able to swap storage providers or buckets without changing the client itself.

> Note: Currently, you need to be authenticated to perform file uploads.

## How does it work?

1. Configure your S3 Bucket (see reference below for more info)
1. Use the generated Client to upload files

It's that easy! Here's an example using a generated TypeScript client with React.
It contains a basic form with the input type "file".
On submit, we're creating a FormData object with all the files submitted and upload them to the S3 bucket you've configured, done.
Btw. , this works with any environment that can send FormData using HTTP Requests.

```typescript jsx
const UploadPage: NextPage = () => {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<FileList>()
  const [data, setData] = useState([])

  const { upload, data } = useFileUpload()

  const onFileChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => {
    setFiles(e.target.files)
  }
  const onSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent<Element>) => {
    e.preventDefault()

    const result = await upload({
      provider: 'minio'
      files,
    })

    if (result) {
      setData(result)
    }
  }

  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>Upload multiple files to any S3 compatible file server</h1>
      <h3>
        Comment out the S3 section in{' '}
        <code>.wundergraph/wundergraph.config.ts:141</code> and run{' '}
        <code>minio/setup.sh</code> to start your own S3 server.
      </h3>
      {!WUNDERGRAPH_S3_ENABLED && (
        <p>Please enable S3 first to be able to upload files.</p>
      )}
      {WUNDERGRAPH_S3_ENABLED && (
        <div>
          <form onSubmit={onSubmit}>
            <input
              id="file-input"
              type="file"
              multiple
              onChange={onFileChange}
            />
            <button type="submit">Submit</button>
          </form>
          <ul>
            {data.map((file) => (
              <li>
                <a
                  target="_blank"
                  href={`http://localhost:9000/uploads/${file}`}
                >
                  {file}
                </a>
              </li>
            ))}
          </ul>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Configuring upload profiles

Additionally, S3 uploads support defining different profiles with limits and an optional metadata schema. Start by adding your
profiles to your `wundergraph.config.ts`:

```typescript
configureWunderGraphApplication({
  ...
	s3UploadProvider: [
		{
      ...
			uploadProfiles: {
        // 'avatar' profile
				avatar: {
					maxAllowedUploadSizeBytes: 1024 * 1024 * 10, // 10 MB, optional, defaults to 25 MB
					maxAllowedFiles: 1, // limit the number of files to 1, leave undefined for unlimited files
					allowedMimeTypes: ['image/png', 'image/jpeg'], // wildcard is supported, e.g. 'image/*', leave empty/undefined to allow all
					allowedFileExtensions: ['png', 'jpg'], // leave empty/undefined to allow all
          // Optional metadata schema as JSON schema
					meta: {
						type: 'object',
						properties: {
							postId: {
								type: 'string',
							},
						},
					},
				},
				gallery: {
          // Metadata defined with zod
					meta: z.object({
						postId: z.string(),
						position: z.number().positive(),
					}),
				},
```

After you define profiles for a given storage provider, you must indicate the profile name when performing an upload. For example,
to use the `avatar` profile use:

```typescript
const result = await upload({
  provider: 'minio',
  profile: 'avatar',
  files,
})
```

When using a profile with required metadata, `upload()` argument will also need to include a properly defined `metadata` field,
accoding to its schema.

## Upload hooks

Upload profiles also allow you to define hooks that will be run before and after the upload. The `preUpload` hook will run
before the upload, allowing you to perform any required validation as well as defining the path to store the file. There's
also a `postUpload` hook which runs after the upload completes or fails (the `error` argument indicates that). To use upload
hooks, define them in your `wundergraph.server.ts` file:

```typescript
export default configureWunderGraphServer<HooksConfig, InternalClient>(() => ({
	hooks: {
    ...
		uploads: {
			minio: {
				avatar: {
					preUpload: ({ user, file, meta }) => {
						console.log(`preUpload user: ${user}, file: ${file}, meta: ${meta}`);
						if (!user) {
              // Optional: return an error if the user is not authenticated
							return { error: 'authenticate' };
						}
            // Optional: Return a fileKey to override the default path for storing the
            // file. Use / as a directory separator.
            //
            // e.g. return { fileKey: 'directory/' + file.name };
            //
						// e.g. return {fileKey: 'customname.png'};
            //
            // Or don't return anything to use the default filename derived from the file contents.
					},
					postUpload: async ({ user, file, meta, internalClient, error }) => {
						console.log(
							`postUpload user: ${user}, file: ${file}, meta: ${meta}, internalClient: ${internalClient}, error: ${error}`
						);
					},
				},
			},
		},
	},
}));
```
