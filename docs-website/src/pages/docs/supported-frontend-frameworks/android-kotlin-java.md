Support for Android with Kotlin and Java is planned,
but there's not yet a schedule.
If you're interested in support for this platform,
please join our Discord Server and let us know.

If you're planning to use WunderGraph commercially,
we're also able to speed up the development of required features with our dedicated support team.
Please reach out to our Sales Team if you're interested in learning more about our services.
