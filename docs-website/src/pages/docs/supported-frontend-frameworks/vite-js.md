WunderGraph has native support for React.js and Vite.

Our official recommendation is to use the native [swr integration](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph/tree/main/packages/swr).

We've built the client generation very flexible,
so you can use the WunderGraph TypeScript client,
combine it with the SWR integration,
and use it with frameworks like Next.JS, Vite, or even plain React.

## Examples of using Next.js and WunderGraph

If you're looking for examples, here's a list:
