WunderGraph has official support for Next.js and React.js.

Our official recommendation is to use the native [WunderGraph Next.js integration](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph/tree/main/packages/nextjs).

This integration combines the super powers of WunderGraph, Next.js and SWR to provide a great developer experience.
