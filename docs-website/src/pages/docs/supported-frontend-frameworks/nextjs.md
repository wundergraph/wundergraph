WunderGraph has official support for Next.js and React.js.

Our official recommendation is to use the native [NextJS WunderGraph swr integration](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph/tree/main/packages/swr).

This integration combines the super powers of WunderGraph, NextJS and swr to provide a great developer experience.
You'll get all the features of WunderGraph, combined with NextJS and everything that swr has to offer.
