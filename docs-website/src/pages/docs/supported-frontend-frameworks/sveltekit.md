WunderGraph has official support for Svelte and SvelteKit

We have added support for Svelte, using Tanstack's Svelte Query.

You can stay very low level and just use the generated TypeScript client,
or you use Svelte Query which also supports Server Side Rendering.

It's also possible to just use fetch and combine it with the generated TypeScript models.
Have a look at the WunderGraph Protocol to learn more about using the JSON-RPC API directly.

That said, the easiest way to use WunderGraph in Svelte is by using the Svelte Query integration.

Let's assume, we've defined a virtual Graph with a Weather API and defined an operation to get the current weather for a given city.
Here's how the integration would look like.

First, let's define the Operation in our virtual Graph.

```graphql
# .wundergraph/operations/Weather.graphql
query ($forCity: String!) {
  weather: weather_getCityByName(name: $forCity) @transform(get: "weather") {
    # we're using the @transform directive to flatten the response
    weather {
      summary {
        title
        description
        icon
      }
      temperature {
        actual
        min
        max
      }
    }
  }
}
```

WunderGraph will automatically "compile" this Operation into a JSON-RPC API,
and generate a TypeSafe Svelte Query function,
which we can call from our Svelte page.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
  const liveWeather = createQuery({
    operationName: 'Weather',
    input: { forCity: 'Berlin' },
    liveQuery: true,
  });
</script>

<div>
  <div>
    <h3>City: {$liveWeather.data?.weather?.name}</h3>
    <p>{JSON.stringify($liveWeather.data?.weather?.coord)}</p>
    <h3>Temperature</h3>
    <p>{JSON.stringify($liveWeather.data?.weather?.temperature)}</p>
    <h3>Wind</h3>
    <p>{JSON.stringify($liveWeather.data?.weather?.wind)}</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

You add prefetch logic and make the query server rendered. Based on [SvelteQuery SSR support](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/svelte/ssr#using-prefetchquery)

```ts
export const load: PageLoad = async ({ parent }) => {
  const { queryClient } = await parent();

  await prefetchQuery(
    {
      operationName: 'Weather',
      input: { forCity: 'Berlin' },
    },
    queryClient
  );
};
```

This page, although it's a live query, will be rendered on the server.
Once the client picks up the page, it will automatically subscribe to the live query.
This works as well for GraphQL Subscriptions, Kafka Streams, and any other live query.
But in this case, we're simply using server-side polling to get the latest weather data.
