WunderGraph has full support for Solid.js. You can use the [Solid Query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/solid/overview) library to fetch data from your WunderGraph application. We have a [Solid Query client](/docs/clients-reference/solid-query) that you can use to generate type-safe hooks for your application.
