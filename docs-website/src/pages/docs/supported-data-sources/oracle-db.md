description: WunderGraph is the easiest way to expose Oracle DB databases through GraphQL.
---

Oracle DB is a popular relational database.
Combined with WunderGraph,
you can easily expose your Oracle DB database through the WunderGraph JSON-RPC API layer.

WunderGraph automatically introspects all your tables and generates a GraphQL Schema for you.
This schema is then added to your virtual Graph,
allowing you to define API Operations by writing GraphQL,
or even integrating it with other data sources,
e.g. through WunderGraph's Cross API JOIN feature.

## Current state

The Oracle DB DataSource is currently in "planning" state.
If you're interested in this DataSource,
please reach out to our Sales team.
