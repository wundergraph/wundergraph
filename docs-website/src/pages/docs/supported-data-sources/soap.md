description: WunderGraph is the easiest way to expose SOAP APIs through GraphQL.
---

At WunderGraph, one of our main goals is to make it as easy as possible to leverage existing APIs.
SOAP is a popular technology for exposing APIs via a XML-based protocol.

With WunderGraph, you can plug all your SOAP APIs into a single GraphQL API.
Use existing legacy SOAP APIs as if they were modern GraphQL APIs.

## Reference
