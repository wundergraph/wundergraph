description: WunderGraph is the easiest way to expose SOAP APIs through GraphQL.

At WunderGraph, one of our main goals is to make it as easy as possible to leverage existing APIs.
SOAP is a popular technology for exposing APIs via a XML-based protocol.

With WunderGraph, you can plug all your SOAP APIs into a single GraphQL API.
Use existing legacy SOAP APIs as if they were modern GraphQL APIs.

## Current state

Currently, the SOAP DataSource is in the "planning" stage.
If you're interested in using WunderGraph with SOAP,
please reach out to us on Discord,
we'd love to hear from you!
