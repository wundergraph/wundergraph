title: OData support
description: WunderGraph is the easiest way to expose OData APIs through GraphQL.
---

One of our main goals at WunderGraph is to make APIs more accessible.
OData is a popular technology for exposing APIs via a REST-based protocol.

But what if you'd like to use many OData APIs in a single application,
or you'd like to combine your OData APIs with other data sources?
That's where WunderGraph comes in.

With WunderGraph, you can plug all your OData APIs into a single Graph.

## Current state

The development of the OData DataSource is still in "planning" stage.
If you're interested in using it,
please reach out to us on Discord,
we'd love to hear from you!
