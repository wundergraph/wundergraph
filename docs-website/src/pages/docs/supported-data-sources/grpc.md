title: gRPC GraphQL support
description: WunderGraph is the easiest way to expose gRPC APIs through GraphQL.
---

gRPC is a popular technology for exposing APIs via a binary protocol.
While mostly used for services-to-services communication, it can also be used to expose APIs to the public.

However, consuming gRPC APIs from browser-based applications is not as easy as it might sound.
It's complex enough to talk to a single gRPC API,
but when you have to talk to multiple gRPC APIs,
it gets worse.

With WunderGraph, you can plug all your gRPC APIs into a single GraphQL API.
This way, you can easily consume all your gRPC APIs from a single endpoint,
securely exposed through the WunderGraph RPC layer.

## Current state

The development of the gRPC DataSource is still in progress,
but it's almost ready to be used.

If you're interested in using it,
please reach out to us on Discord,
we'd love to hear from you!
