## [Enable autocompletion in your IDE](/docs/guides/enable-autocompletion-in-your-ide)

Follow this guide to enable autocompletion in your IDE.
This helps a lot when defining your (GraphQL) Operations.

## [Inject short-lived token into upstream requests](/docs/guides/inject-short-lived-token-into-upstream-requests)

This guide helps you to add a middleware to inject short-lived auth tokens into origin requests.

## [Expose a GraphQL API from WunderGraph](/docs/guides/expose-a-graphql-api-from-wundergraph)

A fundamental feature of WunderGraph is to secure your GraphQL API by putting a RPC interface in front of it.
But sometimes, you really want to directly expose your GraphQL API instead.
In this case, you can follow this guide.

## [Extend JSON fields with more specific types](/docs/guides/extend-json-fields-with-more-specific-types)

Some databases expose APIs with generic JSON fields.
This guide helps you to extend these fields with more specific types to increase type-safety.

## [Signing origin requests](/docs/guides/signing-origin-requests)

Similarly to injecting a short-lived token,
this guide helps you to sign requests,
which is a requirement for some APIs.

## [Configure Authorization](/docs/guides/configure-authorization)
