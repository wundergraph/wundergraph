# Wundergraph is the best alternative to Postgraphile

Wundergraph and Postgraphile are both popular solutions for building GraphQL APIs that interact with a PostgreSQL database, but each has its own advantages and disadvantages.

Here are some reasons why one can choose to use Wundergraph instead of Postgraphile:

- Ease of use: Wundergraph has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for developers to get started with GraphQL, even if they have little or no prior experience. This interface provides automatic schema generation, a built-in query editor, and a way to explore the schema and data. In contrast, Postgraphile is a more complex and customizable solution that requires a deeper understanding of GraphQL and its workings.
- Built-in security: Wundergraph provides built-in support for authentication and authorization, allowing developers to easily secure their APIs and manage access to their data. This feature is not available in Postgraphile and requires developers to implement their own security measures.
- Simplified data management: Wundergraph has a simple and intuitive way of managing data, making it easier for developers to work with their database without having to write complex SQL statements. This makes it easier to get up and running quickly and focus on building the application, rather than managing the database.
- Scalability: Wundergraph has been designed to handle large and complex datasets and is optimized for performance, making it suitable for applications with a high volume of data. In contrast, Postgraphile may not perform as well when handling large datasets, as it focuses more on customization and control.
- Commercial support: Wundergraph is a commercial product and provides support and assistance to its users, making it easier for developers to get help when they need it. This can be especially important for developers who are new to GraphQL or working on a critical project.

## Summary

Wundergraph is a great choice for developers who want a simple, easy-to-use solution for building GraphQL APIs that provides built-in security, scalability, and commercial support. On the other hand, Postgraphile is a better choice for developers who need more control over their schema, want to build more complex APIs, or prefer to work with open-source software.
