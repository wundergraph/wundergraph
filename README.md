## What is WunderGraph?

WunderGraph is the **Next-Generation API Developer Platform** with a focus on Developer Experience.

At its core, WunderGraph combines the [API Gateway pattern](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) with
the [Backend for Frontend (BFF)](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern to create the perfect
Developer Experience for working with APIs.

Take all your (micro-)services, Databases, File Storages, Identity Providers as well as 3rd party APIs and combine them
into your own Firebase-like Developer Toolkit, without getting locked into a specific vendor.

Imagine that each of your applications could have its own dedicated BFF, while being able to share common logic across
all your applications, that's the WunderGraph Experience.

## Getting started

The fastest way to get started with WunderGraph is to open a Gitpod. After bootstrapping the [examples/simple](examples/simple) is started.

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph)

You can also following the [**Quickstart (5
min)**](https://wundergraph.com/docs/guides/getting_started/quickstart) if you don't want to use Gitpod.

## Examples:

- [Simple Starter](/examples/simple)
- [NextJS](/examples/nextjs)
- [FaunaDB Starter](/examples/faunadb-nextjs)
- [PostgreSQL](/examples/postgres)
- [NextJS, PostgreSQL, Prisma](/examples/nextjs-postgres-prisma)
- [Apollo Federation, REST/OpenAPI, NextJS](https://github.com/wundergraph/wundergraph-demo)
- [Subscriptions & Live Queries](./examples/nextjs-postgres-prisma)
- [Cross API joins across data-sources](/examples/cross-api-joins)
- [Inject a Bearer Token with Auth0](./examples/inject-bearer)
- [Publish & Install APIs](./examples/publish-install-api)

## The WunderGraph Stack

WunderGraph is made up of the three core components:

- [**wunderctl**](packages/wunderctl): A command line tool to create, deploy and manage your WunderGraph application.
- [**SDK**](packages/sdk): Auto-generated and type-safe client to configure and interact with your WunderGraph.
- [**WunderHub**](https://hub.wundergraph.com/) The Package Manager for APIs that allows you to share and integrate your
  API's in a few clicks.

The auto-generated type-safe client can be used in _any_ Node.js or TypeScript backend application (including serverless
applications and microservices).

## Core features

- **Unified Graph**: Combine all your data sources into a unified GraphQL Schema.
- **JSON-RPC**: Expose GraphQL operations through JSON-RPC.
  Learn [more](https://wundergraph-landing-git-feat-update-landing-jensneuse.vercel.app/blog/graphql_is_not_meant_to_be_exposed_over_the_internet)
  about this design choice.
- **Type-Safe Clients**: Auto generate custom type-safe API Clients with Authentication / Authorization and file upload
  support.
- **Customizable**: Customizable gateway logic with TypeScript.
- **Standards**: Build upon standards like GraphQL, OpenAPI, OAuth2, S3...
- **Open Source**: 100% Open Source, No vendor lock-in.
- **Community**: First-class support for frameworks like Next.js, React, Svelte...

> **Note**: [WunderHub](https://hub.wundergraph.com/) is our vision of the Package Manager for APIs. Like npm, but for APIs. Sign up for free!

## Architecture & Key Differentiators

<div align="center">
    <img src="./assets/wundergraph_architecture_overview_light_transparent.png" height="auto"/>
</div>

WunderGraph is unique in its design,
as we're not directly exposing GraphQL,
but JSON-RPC. Combined with a generated Type-Safe client,
this leads to a unique Developer Experience.
You can learn more about the architecture of WunderGraph and why we've built it this way in [the architecture section](docs/architecture.md).

## Learn more about WunderGraph

If you'd like to get a quick overview,
have a look at these [annotated example snippets](docs/at-a-glance.md).

## How does WunderGraph work

This section provides a high-level overview of how WunderGraph works and its most consumer centric components. For a
more thorough introduction, visit the [architecture](./docs/architecture) documentation.

After initializing your first WunderGraph application with `npx @wundergraph/wunderctl init`, you have a NPM package and
a `.wundergraph` folder. This folder contains the following files:

- `wundergraph.config.ts` - The primary config file for your WunderGraph application. Add data-sources and more.
- `wundergraph.operations.ts` - Configure authentication, caching and more for a specific or all operations.
- `wundergraph.server.ts` - The hooks server to hook into different lifecycle events of your gateway.

After configuring your data-sources, you can start writing operations. An operation is just a `*.graphql` file. The name
of the file will be the operation name. You can write queries, mutations and subscriptions that spans multiple
data-sources. Each operation will be exposed securely via HTTP JSON-API through the WunderGraph gateway. After writing
your operations, you can start deploying your WunderGraph application.
