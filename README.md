## What is WunderGraph?

WunderGraph is a **Backend for Frontend (BFF) Framework** designed to optimize Developer Workflows through API Composition.

At its core, WunderGraph combines two patterns, [API Gateway](https://microservices.io/patterns/apigateway.html) and [BFF](https://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/)
with the concept of a package manager, making API composition as simple as npm install.
Our mantra is: **Compose, don't integrate**.

**API Composition** is a new pattern that allows you to interact with a heterogeneous set of APIs as if they were a single unified API.
This not just eliminates a lot of glue code, but also allows you to reason about the API Dependencies of an application.
Do you actually know what APIs and Services your application depends on?
WunderGraph can easily answer this question for you,
and even gives you analytics and observability into what APIs and Endpoints are used by your application and what the quality of service your API dependencies provide.

## WunderGraph in a nutshell

Here's how WunderGraph works:

1. **Compose your APIs**

```typescript
// .wundergraph/wundergraph.config.ts

// introspect a PostgreSQL database
const pg = introspect.postgresql({
  apiNamespace: 'pg',
  databaseURL: new EnvironmentVariable('PG_DATABASE_URL'),
});

// introspect the Stripe API using OpenAPI
const stripe = introspect.openApiV2({
  apiNamespace: 'stripe',
  source: {
    kind: 'file',
    filePath: './stripe.yaml',
  },
  headers: (builder) => builder.addClientRequestHeader('Authorization', `Bearer ${process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY}`),
});

// introspect the Shopify Storefront API using GraphQL
const shopify = introspect.graphql({
  apiNamespace: 'shopify',
  url: 'https://my-shop.myshopify.com/api/2021-07/graphql.json',
  headers: (builder) =>
    builder.addStaticHeader('X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token', new EnvironmentVariable('SHOPIFY_STOREFRONT_TOKEN')),
});

configureWunderGraphApplication({
  // compose the APIs into a unified WunderGraph API
  apis: [pg, stripe, shopify],
});
```

WunderGraph allows you to create a code pipeline to introspect and compose multiple APIs into a unified API.
This makes it easy to update an API dependency without a single click.

2. **Define an Operation**

By combining the introspected APIs, WunderGraph generates a unified GraphQL Schema across all APIs.
All we have to do is define an Operation and call it from our Frontend.

```graphql
# .wundergraph/operations/users/ByID.graphql
query ($id: String!) {
  user: db_findFirstUser(where: { id: { equals: $id } }) {
    id
    email
    name
    bio
  }
}
```

Alternatively, you can also define a custom Operation using TypeScript:

```typescript
// .wundergraph/operations/users/CustomByID.ts
import { createOperation, z } from '../../generated/wundergraph.factory';

export default createOperation.query({
  input: z.object({
    id: z.string(),
  }),
  handler: async ({ input }) => {
    return {
      id: input.id,
      name: 'Jens',
      bio: 'Founder of WunderGraph',
    };
  },
});
```

3. **Call the Operation** from your Frontend

As you define Operations, WunderGraph automatically generates a type-safe client for your Frontend,
supporting all major Frontend Frameworks like React, NextJS, Remix, Astro, Svelte, Expo, Vue, etc...

```typescript jsx
import { client } from '~/lib/wundergraph';

export default async function ProfilePage(props) {
  const { data, error } = await client.query({
    operationName: 'users/ByID',
    input: {
      id: props.params.id,
    },
  });

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>{data.user.name}</h1>
      <p>{data.user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In the same vein, you could now add Authentication, Authorization, file uploads, etc...

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started from scratch is to use the following command:

```shell
npx create-wundergraph-app my-project --example nextjs
```

If you already have an existing project, you can add WunderGraph to it by running:

```shell
npx create-wundergraph-app --init
```

## The WunderGraph Stack

WunderGraph is made up of the three core components:

- [**wunderctl**](packages/wunderctl): A command line tool to create, deploy and manage your WunderGraph application.
- [**SDK**](packages/sdk): Create, configure & extend your WunderGraph Application with TypeScript.

## Core features

- **APIs as Dependencies** - Define which data sources your frontend depends on and WunderGraph handles the rest. Say goodbye to unmaintainable glue-code, focus on **adding real business value**.
- **Backend for Frontend Architecture** - WunderGraph lives next to your frontend code, but can also be used stand alone as an API Gateway. Whatever you're building, you can always depend on the same **great DX**.
- **End-to-End-TypeSafety** - Start new projects in minutes with powerful conventions and code generation. WunderGraph generates **instant, typesafe API clients**, including authentication and file uploads.
- **API Composition with Namespacing** - WunderGraph is the only tool that allows you to **compose multiple APIs** into a single unified API without naming collisions or manual configuration thanks to **API namespacing**.

## Architecture & Key Differentiators

You can learn more about the architecture of WunderGraph and why we’ve built it this way in [the architecture section](docs/architecture.md).

## How does WunderGraph work

This section provides a high-level overview of how WunderGraph works and its most consumer centric components. For a
more thorough introduction, visit the [architecture](./docs/architecture) documentation.

After initializing your WunderGraph application, you have a NPM package and
a `.wundergraph` folder. This folder contains the following files:

- `wundergraph.config.ts` - The primary config file for your WunderGraph application. Add data-sources and more.
- `wundergraph.operations.ts` - Configure authentication, caching and more for a specific or all operations.
- `wundergraph.server.ts` - The hooks server to hook into different lifecycle events of your gateway.

As a user of WunderGraph, you add your data-sources and authentication configuration to the `wundergraph.config.ts` file.
You will then define your Operations by creating either a `*.graphql` or `*.ts` file in the `.wundergraph/operations/` directory.
Using GraphQL, you can directly interact with the GraphQL Schema of your data-sources.
If you'd like to add more customization, you can also use TypeScript to define custom operations.

All Operations are then compiled into JSON-RPC and served by the WunderGraph Gateway.
You can either use one of the generated type-safe clients, or try out the API using the Postman Collection or OpenAPI Specification which will be generated in the `.wundergraph/generated` directory.
